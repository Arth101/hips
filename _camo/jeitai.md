A new camouflage design based on the German Army's flecktarn was introduced in 1991 for issue to the entire JSDF. The pattern features black, brown and grass green dots on a khaki background, and is produced in a variety of uniform articles as well as field equipment. The pattern is often called Jeitai in reference to the indigenous name for the JSDF.
