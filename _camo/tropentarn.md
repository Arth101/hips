Tropentarn, formerly also called Wüstentarn (German armed forces tropical or desert camouflage), is a camouflage pattern used by the Bundeswehr in arid and semi arid regions. It is the desert variant of Flecktarn. Its official name is 3-Farb-Tarndruck (3-color camouflage print) – Instead of the 5-color scheme of greens, brown, and black of temperate Flecktarn, it uses only three colors: a base color of khaki tan with medium brown and dark green spots.
