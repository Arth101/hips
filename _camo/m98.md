Circa 1998 a new style uniform was fielded for the Norwegian Army - the M/98 pattern. This uniform used essentially the same camouflage pattern as the M/75, although the colors are different. A ripstop version of the standard combat uniform was introduced in 2004, printed using the same colorway. As with earlier Norwegian patterns, subtle color differences are found among different production runs.
