The M05 family of military camouflage patterns are used by the Finnish Defence Forces on uniforms and other equipment. The pattern is licensed by the Finnish Defence Forces and has recently become available to the public as of 26 September, 2016. The first M05 items were issued to troops around 2007, and have nearly universally replaced the M91 pattern in service use.

Originally taken in use before other gear of M05 family and is officially called M04 although pattern has the same basic features and looks as other M05 family patterns. The first M04 items were taken in use around 2003 by Finnish contingent of UN peacekeeping mission in Eritrea (UNMEE) as a test pattern called K2004. K2004 garments were printed into heavier cloth than current M04 that is printed to Ripstop cloth. Currently the pattern is used by FDF international forces in Afghanistan (ISAF). It was also used UN operations in Chad and Central African Republic (MINURCAT) and Lebanon (UNIFIL II). Also Finnish officers serving in arid climate as UN Military Observers use M04 pattern equipment.

The Finnish M05 camo was made commercially available as of the 26th of September 2016. Until then it had been copyright protected by the Defence Forces and all commercial production and sales have been prohibited.
