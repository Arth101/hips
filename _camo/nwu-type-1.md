In 2007 the US Navy introduced its own uniform, the Navy Working Uniform (NWU), using a re-coloration of the Army's UCP or Universal Camouflage Pattern. The pattern is not intented to hide the personnel wearing it, but rather to camouflage paint, oil stains, and other potential soiling, as well as to give the US Navy its own identitfiable working uniform. The pattern has subsequently come to be called NWU-1 (or NWU Type I), as the Navy adopted two additional camouflage patterns for personnel operating in combat theaters (see below). Within the Navy, this pattern has earned the nickname "blueberries."

In August 2016 the U.S. Navy announced that it is eliminating the NWU Type I in favor of the Type III which will completely replace it by 1 October 2019 for wear as the standard working uniform ashore for all Navy personnel. The Type II will remain restricted to wear by Naval Special Warfare sailors when in desert environments. The Navy's goal of developing a single working uniform for wear aboard ship and ashore and by all ranks and rates which the NWU Type I was supposed to fulfill was never realized by the Type I. Soon after its introduction it was found to be unsuitable for shipboard wear because of its lack of flame resistance and so was banned from wear aboard ship (except for when in port) thus making it essentially a uniform to be worn while ashore only. As a uniform for wear ashore only, a pattern designed to conceal stains aboard ships is not nearly as effective at concealment as a pattern designed to conceal people on land, thus the IIIs are used ashore anyways. That being the case, the NWU Type I has become a uniform without a purpose. The Navy continues to work to develop a shipboard working uniform.
