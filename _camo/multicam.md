MultiCam is a Crye Precision camouflage pattern designed for use in a wide range of conditions. Variants of it, some unlicensed, are in use with armed forces. The pattern is also sold for civilian usage.

##History
First introduced in 2002, MultiCam was designed for the use of the U.S. Army in varied environments, seasons, elevations, and light conditions. It is a seven-color, multi-environment camouflage pattern developed by Crye Precision in conjunction with United States Army Soldier Systems Center.

The pattern was included in the U.S. Army's move to replace the 3-Color Desert and Woodland patterns, but in 2004 lost to the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) that came to be used in the Army Combat Uniform. However, it was re-commissioned by the U.S. Army in 2010, replacing UCP for units deploying to the War in Afghanistan, under the designation, Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OEFCP). It had already been used by some American special operations units and civilian law enforcement agencies.

MultiCam is available for commercial sale to civilians.

A version of MultiCam has been adopted by the armed forces of the United Kingdom as the Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP), replacing their previous DPM camouflage. MTP retains the color palette of Multicam but incorporates shapes similar to the previous DPM scheme. After using the Multicam scheme in Afghanistan, Australia has also adopted its own version, combining the pattern of Multicam with the color palette of its earlier DPCU / Auscam pattern.

On 25 November 2013, Crye Precision unveiled a family of MultiCam variants. The variants are designed for arid, tropic and snow-covered environments, plus a black variant for use by law enforcement tactical teams.
