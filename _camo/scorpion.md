Scorpion W2 is a camouflage pattern adopted by the United States Army for future use as the U.S. Army's main camouflage pattern on uniforms, under the name Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP). This new pattern will replace the Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) as the official combat uniform pattern for most U.S. soldiers. The new pattern will also replace the closely related MultiCam, a pattern previously used for troops deploying to Afghanistan.

The original Scorpion pattern was developed by a joint venture of the Army's Natick Labs and Crye Precision as part of the Objective Force Warrior program more than a decade ago. It was then modified into MultiCam by Crye for commercial sales. The Scorpion W2 variant was modified from the initial pattern by Natick Labs. In July 2014, the Army announced that OCP could be used in the field by the summer of 2015.

In early April 2015, Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno revealed that OCP uniforms were beginning to be issued to deployed soldiers going to Afghanistan, Iraq, Europe, and the Horn of Africa. The OCP ACU became available for soldiers to purchase starting July 1, 2015.
