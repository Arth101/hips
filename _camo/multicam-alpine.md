MultiCam Alpine is a commercial pattern, designed for snowy areas.

From the MultiCam website:
"*The MultiCam Alpine pattern was developed to effectively reduce the visual and near-IR signature of a person operating in snow-covered environments. It is intended to be used in every area of operation that receives significant snowfall. The MultiCam Alpine pattern can be paired with MultiCam gear as needed to appropriately match the overall level of snow cover present.*"
