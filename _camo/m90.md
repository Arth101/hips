M90 camouflage is the camouflage pattern used by the Swedish Armed Forces. In addition to the standard pattern, desert and jungle variants have been developed for the international peace-keeping missions in Afghanistan and Liberia. The pattern employs basically a downscaled pattern of what has been used on vehicles since the late 1970s, consisting of hard lined geometric shapes in order to create a camouflage pattern effective in the temperate forests and plains of Sweden. M90 camouflage comprises four colours: dark green, medium green, dark navy blue and grey. Navy blue was chosen instead of black because natural shadows generally tend to be in shades of blue to the human eye.
