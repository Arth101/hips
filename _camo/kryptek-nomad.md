Kryptek camouflage patterns are commercial patterns, often used by hunters. The patterns are not used officially by any the military branches.

From Kryptek's webpage:

"*Kryptek's battlefield DNA is evident in everything we do. We took what we learned in the most hostile combat environments and combined that knowledge with proven tactical gear concepts, tested it with top military professionals and hunters, and then customized every aspect to perform in all potential backcountry scenarios. Unlike traditional stick and leaf camouflage, Kryptek's design incorporates micro and macro layering inspired by artillery camouflage netting. This creates a 3D appearance on a 2D surface and near-invisibility. In fact, the Department of Defense used laser-retinal-tracking to prove it took subjects longer to locate people wearing Kryptek camouflage than any other, proving that Kryptek camo is the most effective camouflage available.This industry-leading camouflage is used in all of Kryptek’s adventure products, which are finished with the toughest zippers and bonded seams available. You get comfort, function, and performance that exceeds expectations in the most extreme environments. “Battlefield to Backcountry” aren’t just words, they are Kryptek.*"

About the Nomad pattern:

"*A theater of operations that is harsh and desolate requires deception of a certain type. Kryptek Nomad serves when the surroundings are barren and the environment is hostile.*"
