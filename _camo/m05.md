The M05 family of military camouflage patterns are used by the Finnish Defence Forces on uniforms and other equipment. The pattern is licensed by the Finnish Defence Forces and has recently become available to the public as of 26 September, 2016. The first M05 items were issued to troops around 2007, and have nearly universally replaced the M91 pattern in service use.

The basis of the planning of the new pattern are various photographs of Finnish forests taken by the Finnish Forest Research Institute. The photographs were then digitally edited by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland's Information Technology Institute and concentrated into a 4-colour pattern representative of a Finnish forest. Dark charcoal grey, was added to the pattern in order to represent shadowed areas in a forest.

The pattern was field tested several times, leading to small changes. The new pattern was considered to be significantly better than the old M62 and M91 camouflage patterns.

The Finnish M05 camo was made commercially available as of the 26th of September 2016. Until then it had been copyright protected by the Defence Forces and all commercial production and sales have been prohibited.
