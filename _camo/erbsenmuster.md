The Erbsenmuster or pea-dot pattern (also known as Dot 44, dot pattern or Peas 44) was one of a family of German World War II camouflage patterns, first issued on 1 March 1944. The pea-dot was a major departure from the earlier camouflage smocks. The two piece uniform was designed to be worn over the wool service uniform or by itself and was designated as both a combat and work uniform. The more common later version featured a jacket without the shoulder board loops and sleeve eagle.
