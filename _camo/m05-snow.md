The M05 family of military camouflage patterns are used by the Finnish Defence Forces on uniforms and other equipment. The pattern is licensed by the Finnish Defence Forces and has recently become available to the public as of 26 September, 2016. The first M05 items were issued to troops around 2007, and have nearly universally replaced the M91 pattern in service use.

The snow pattern is a 2-colour version of the M05 woodland pattern. The pattern has been observed to disrupt a soldier's profile so that the new suit cannot be detected at a few dozens of meters' distance in dense snowfall.

The Finnish M05 camo was made commercially available as of the 26th of September 2016. Until then it had been copyright protected by the Defence Forces and all commercial production and sales have been prohibited.
