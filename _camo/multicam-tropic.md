MultiCam Tropic is a commercial pattern, designed for tropic and woodland areas.

From the MultiCam website:

"*The MultiCam Tropic pattern was developed to effectively reduce the visual and near-IR signature of a person operating in dense jungle environments, areas that predominantly consist of lush vegetation that remains relatively unaffected by seasonal changes. The MultiCam Tropic palette compliments and overlaps portions of the main MultiCam pattern; so pairing MultiCam gear with MultiCam Tropic apparel results in a well-coordinated concealment system.*"
