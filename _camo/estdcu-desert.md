In 2006 Estonia introduced a pixelated pattern of black, olive green & rust on moss green background, developed by Andres LÃ¼ll. The uniform is designated Estonian Digital Combat Uniforms or ESTDCU, and is gradually replacing the older design. The design has remarkably strong similarities to the Canadian Armed Forces CADPAT Temperate design.

Also in 2006, a pixelated pattern of sparse brown & grey on sandy background was introduced for deployments to desert regions. This has replaced earlier desert versions as the standard deployment design for arid and desert regions.
