MultiCam Black is a commercial pattern, made to be used by law enforcement, and generally just to look cool.

From the MultiCam Webpage:

"*The MultiCam Black pattern was developed to meet the unique requirements of law enforcement officers operating in high-risk environments. It projects a distinctly authoritative presence appropriate for domestic operations. MultiCam Black is designed to complement an officerâ€™s existing equipment and present a sharp, professional image for top-tier law enforcement units.*"
