M90 camouflage is the camouflage pattern used by the Swedish Armed Forces. In addition to the standard pattern, desert and jungle variants have been developed for the international peace-keeping missions in Afghanistan and Liberia. The pattern employs basically a downscaled pattern of what has been used on vehicles since the late 1970s, consisting of hard lined geometric shapes in order to create a camouflage pattern effective in the temperate forests and plains of Sweden.

M90K has been on issue to troops of the Swedish ISAF contingent from 2004 onward. It contains the standard M90 splinter pattern, recoloured for use in a desert environment. M90K has earth brown, light green and medium gray splinters on a sand-coloured background.
