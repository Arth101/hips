Flecktarn, meaning "mottled camouflage" in german and also known as Flecktarnmuster or Fleckentarn), is a family of 3-, 4-, 5- or 6-color disruptive camouflage patterns, the most common being the five-color pattern, consisting of dark green, light green, black, red brown and green brown or tan depending on the manufacturer. The original German 5-color pattern was designed for use in European temperate woodland terrain. A 3-color variation called WÃ¼stentarn is used for arid and desert conditions and has been used by the German Bundeswehr in Afghanistan.

The original German 5-color flecktarn has been adopted, copied and modified by many countries for their own camouflage patterns.
