In 2006 Estonia introduced a pixelated pattern of black, olive green & rust on moss green background, developed by Andres LÃ¼ll. The uniform is designated Estonian Digital Combat Uniforms or ESTDCU, and is gradually replacing the older design. The design has remarkably strong similarities to the Canadian Armed Forces CADPAT Temperate design.
