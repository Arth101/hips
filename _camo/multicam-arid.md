MultiCam Arid is a commercial pattern, designed for arid and dry areas.

From the MultiCam website:
"*The MultiCam Arid pattern was developed to effectively reduce the visual and near-IR signature of a person operating in desert environments that predominantly consist of open sand and rock. The MultiCam Arid palette compliments and overlaps portions of the main MultiCam pattern; so pairing MultiCam gear with MultiCam Arid apparel results in a well-coordinated concealment system.*"
